## Introduction

This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques, providing valuable insights for investors and traders. The primary goal is to develop accurate models that can forecast future stock prices based on historical data.

## Problem Statement

The volatility and unpredictability of stock prices pose a challenge for investors who seek to make informed decisions. This project addresses the need for reliable stock price predictions, leveraging machine learning algorithms to analyze historical patterns and trends.

## Models Used

- **Random Forest Regressor:** This ensemble learning model is known for its ability to handle complex relationships in the data and provide robust predictions.

- **Support Vector Regressor (SVR):** SVR is employed to capture non-linear relationships and patterns in the stock price data, offering flexibility in modeling.

- **XGBoost Regressor:** An advanced gradient boosting algorithm, XGBoost is utilized to enhance predictive performance, especially in cases with intricate data structures.

## Technologies

- **Python:** The primary programming language for implementing machine learning models and data analysis.

- **Pandas and NumPy:** Utilized for data manipulation and preprocessing.

- **Scikit-learn:** Integrated for implementing machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.

- **XGBoost:** Employed as a powerful gradient boosting library for enhanced predictive modeling.
